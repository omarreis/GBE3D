# SailboatDemo

This demo was added to the fork of GBE3D, by Gregory Bersegeay. 
Features:
* Sailboatdemo is based onoriginal  sample *waterdemo*.
* All assets (3d model and textures) are embedded in the form file (fSailboatDemo.fmx)
* Sailboat model, made with Blender.
* Ocean surface moves as the boat sails (the boats stays in the center). 
* Boat floats and changes pitch with the waves.
* Objects parented to the ocean surface float on it.
* A system of TDummys allow setting boat's *course*, *heel* and *sail sheets* (main and jib) 
* A rock with a lighthouse.
* A couple floating objects
* As the boat moves, it leaves a trail of floating bubbles. Bubbles are recicled after a while.  
* Added a scrollable listbox to contain the controls.
* Camera controls ( AngleOfView and design camera)

In order to compile this demo, you have to compile and install the GBE3D design package in this fork,
as I have added a few components.
